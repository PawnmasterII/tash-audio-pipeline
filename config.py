# those consumers need to know how stale an audio event is by the time they see
# it. These are PER-STAGE ENGINEERING BUDGET TARGETS, not measured values — they
# are the ceilings each stage is expected to stay under, used for sync planning.
#
# ⚠️  NOT MEASURED on this hardware. To measure on yours, wrap each stage's
#     `.process(...)` call in `time.perf_counter()` over a representative chunk
#     stream and replace these numbers. Vosk final-result latency in particular
#     is data-dependent (it waits for a speech→silence edge) and dominates.
# Surfaced to the monorepo fusion layer as DetectionEvent metadata
# (metadata["audio_latency_ms"] = TOTAL_LATENCY_MS). See
